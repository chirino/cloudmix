# Testing

Creating your own Test Cloud to run distributed test cases

--- name:content

One of the main aims of Cloudmix is to make it easy to spin up your own clouds to provision software inside.

The following instructions walk you through running a distributed test case from the [source code](source.html).

## Running your first distributed test

### Building

* first you need to get the [source code](source.html)
* now [build it](building.html)

### Run the Test Cloud Controller

Now we need to run the Test Cloud on a machine somewhere. For now lets run it on your local machine

    cd org.fusesource.cloudmix.controller.webapp
    mvn jetty:run
    
You should be able to see the currently active profiles (i.e. distributed tests running) by pointing your web browser at

* [http://localhost:8181/profiles](http://localhost:8181/profiles)

### Run a distributed test case

Now lets try one of the examples which comes with cloudmix.

    cd cloudtests/org.fusesource.cloudmix.testing.samples
    mvn test -Dtest=ActiveMQTest -Pit    
    
Or you can run them all via

    mvn test -Pit
    
The integration tests are associated with the *it* profile; so that the tests can be build and ran without needing a whole test cloud.

**Note that this test should fail as there are no agents in the cloud!** If you type this

    more target/surefire-reports/org.fusesource.cloudmix.testing.samples.ActiveMQTest.txt 
    
you should see, after about a minute, an error that the broker feature could not be provisioned.

### Adding agents to the Test Cloud

You need some agents (or slaves) in the Test Cloud to actually run the various features used in your test. 

To do this the simplest way is to boot up a number of agents using the [MOP](http://mop.fusesource.org) agent as follows
    
    cd org.fusesource.cloudmix.agent.mop.web
    mvn jetty:run

You can then look at the web application of the agent to see what its running and access any log files etc. The agent web application will also register its URL with the controller web application, so from the controller URL you can navigate to each agents website.

If you have [MOP](http://mop.fusesource.org) installed you can just type the following instead

    mop cloudmixAgent[:version] [controllerUrl] [profile] [workingDirectory]

So the following example works using the current snapshot release using the [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) controller URL and <b>*</b> as the profile

    mop cloudmixAgent:1.3-SNAPSHOT

If you don't want to expose any agent specific details RESTfully then you can just run a stand alone agent as follows - though the above are recommended.
    
    cd org.fusesource.cloudmix.agent.mop
    mvn compile exec:java
