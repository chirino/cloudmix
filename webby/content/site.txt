The *<%= @config.project_name %>* documentation and site is created using "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ and is stored in subversion "here":<%= @config.project_svn_url %>/webby

h2. Editing the site source code

If you "grab the source code":source.html you can get the site source in the *webby* directory. If you have webby installed (see below for instructions) then you can build the website from "the code":source.html as follows

  svn co <%= @config.project_svn_url %> <%= @config.project_id %>
  cd <%= @config.project_id %>/webby
  webby
  
If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

  webby autobuild
  
You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

If you are on OS X then we highly recommend "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ as a great editor which supports Textile, Markdown, Ruby and ERB etc.

h2. Editing the site in your browser

The generated HTML has a link at the bottom of the page to *Edit This Page!* as well as supporting the "Universal Edit Button":http://universaleditbutton.org/ if your browser supports it. There is also a link to the page source if you are wondering where it is kept in subversion.

If you use FireFox you might want to install the "Edit Page Plugin":https://addons.wikihow.com/univedit.xpi

This feature depends on having a restful resource which will accept posted changes to the page.

h2. Installing Webby

Before running the webby command above you need to install it by "following these instructions":http://webby.rubyforge.org/user-manual/#h1_2

  sudo gem install webby
 
You also need to install "coderay":http://webby.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/Webby/Helpers/CodeRayHelper.html as follows

  sudo gem install coderay
