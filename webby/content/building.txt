h2. Building 

<%= @config.project_name %> uses "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ as its build tool. If you don't fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or "Download":download.html a distribution or JAR.

h3. Prequisites

*Required:*
* Download and "install Maven":http://maven.apache.org/download.html
* Get the latest "Source":source.html 
* Java 1.5

h3. Maven options

To build <%= @config.project_name %> maven has to be configured to use more memory

  set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

h3. A normal build

  mvn install

h3. Doing a Quick Build

The following avoids running all the unit test cases, we just skip the test running phase and not the building part

  mvn -Dtest=false clean install

h3. Using an IDE

If you prefer to use an IDE then you can auto-generate the IDE's project files using maven plugins. e.g.

  mvn eclipse:eclipse
  
or

  mvn idea:idea

h4. Importing into Eclipse

If you have not already done so, you will need to make Eclipse aware of the Maven repository so that it can build everything. In the preferences, go to Java->Build Path->Classpath and define a new Classpath Variable named M2_REPO that points to your local Maven repository (i.e., **~/.m2/repository** on Unix and **c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.m2\repository** on Windows).

You can also get Maven to do this for you:

  mvn eclipse:add-maven-repo -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/the/workspace/ 


h3. Building in ActiveMQ

If you want to build ActiveMQ with <%= @config.project_name %> included, "check out the code":source.html

  svn co <%= @config.project_svn_url %> <%= @config.project_id %>
  cd <%= @config.project_id %>
  mvn clean install

Then if you build trunk of FUSE Message broker

  svn co https://projects.open.iona.com/projects/svn/iona/activemq/trunk/ fuse-activemq
  cd fuse-activemq
  mvn -Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false clean install

then run the tarball

  cd target
  tar xf apache-activemq-5.2.0-fuse-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz 
  cd apache-activemq-5.2.0-fuse-SNAPSHOT
  bin/activemq
