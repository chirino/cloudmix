The *CloudMix* documentation and site is created using "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ 

If you "grab the source code":source.html you can get the webby source in the *webby* directory.

So to "check out the code":source.html and build the website try the following (assuming you have installed webby).

  svn co https://projects.fusesource.com/projects/svn/fusesource/fuseforge/cloudmix/trunk cloudmix
  cd cloudmix/webby
  webby
  

h2. Installing Webby

Before running the webby command above you need to install it by "following these instructions":http://webby.rubyforge.org/user-manual/#h1_2

  sudo gem install webby
 
You also need to install "coderay":http://webby.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/Webby/Helpers/CodeRayHelper.html as follows

  sudo gem install coderay
